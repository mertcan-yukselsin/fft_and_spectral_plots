# fft_and_spectral_plots
This repository introduces a simple but an effective ShinyApp about obtaning FFT and Spectral Density Plots easily.

* In app.R file, the codes are available. The output website can be found here: https://mrreductive.shinyapps.io/fft_and_spectral_plots/

In this app, there are various parameters that can be changed namely:

- Sampling Rate (Hz)

- Harmonic Frequency Selection

- Number of Harmonic to search

- Number of Freq for Spec.ar

- AR Order for Spec.ar


After opening the web application, all you need to do is upload a snapshot file and then changing the parameters in the bottom-left corner.
