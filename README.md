# fft_and_spectral_plots
This repository introduces a simple but an effective ShinyApp about obtaning FFT and Spectral Density Plots easily.

* In app.R file, the codes are available. The output website can be found here: https://mrreductive.shinyapps.io/fft_and_spectral_plots/

In this app, there are various parameters that can be changed namely:

* Sampling Rate (Hz)

* Harmonic Frequency Selection

* # of Harmonic to search

* # of Freq for Spec.ar

* AR Order for Spec.ar
